* [CustomizerGod](https://www.door2windows.com/customizergod/): User-friendly way to replace certain Windows system icons. Was never updated for Windows 11 (or even later builds of Windows 10), so handle with care. **Decided it was simpler to stick to IconPackager combined with Resource Hacker.**


* [SmartTaskbar](https://github.com/ChanpleCai/SmartTaskbar): hide the taskbar only when it makes sense (when the focused window would overlap). **Annoying issue: Taskbar often covers the "Properties" function of the classic Explorer context menu.**

* [TaskbarControl](https://www.thefreewindows.com/3252/hide-completely-the-windows-taskbar-using-a-hotkey-and-unhide-it-with-taskbar-control/): assign a hotkey to toggle autohiding  the taskbar. Useful for touchscreen devices in combination with Stardock's TouchTasks. **Doesnt work as expected on Windows 11.**

* [xmplay](https://www.un4seen.com/):  ridiculously lightweight music player. Skinnable. But could use better high dpi support... See also [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/). **Decided [MPC-HC](https://github.com/clsid2/mpc-hc/releases/) was minimal enough for me.**


* [Ferdium](https://ferdium.org/): centralized portal for webapps. I use this to unite several different chat apps (Google Messages, Hangouts, Discord). The Facebook Messenger portal doesn't play nice with video calling, so I use [Caprine](https://sindresorhus.com/caprine/) for that. **Replaced in my workflow by [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/).**
